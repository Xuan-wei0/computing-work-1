**Teacher's Day Ideas**

story? 
or a poem 
about mr chan and what he does in class

and all the stuff that he does in class
like the scammers
and the jokes that he tells us too
like the map reading ones? 
and also talking about me being a scout

any ideas guys?

(weiyi: ngl teachers' day is already over but i'll just put in what we did):

- a post-it board for each teacher, and hiding it around the classroom for each of them to find
- unique teachers' day video created by the reps of each subject and the class comm
- some gifts for them
